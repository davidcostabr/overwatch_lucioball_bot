# overwatch lucioball bot
A bot for lootboot farming in lucioball

This project requires python and pyautogui to work properly.
Install pyautoguy: `pip install pyautogui`


This is not a bot to play lucioball perfectly. Instead, it will mostly do random movements that will simulate you pressing random keys so you wont be dropped out of the game and also won't seem like you are just being afk.
